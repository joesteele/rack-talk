# Tampa Ruby Brigade Meetup Rack Talk

These are the slides for the talk I gave on [July 18, 2013](http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb/events/125327762/) at the [Tampa Ruby Brigade meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/tampa-rb). The actual slides are in the [slides](https://github.com/joesteele/rack-talk/tree/master/slides) directory. The slides are powered by the HTML presentation framework [reveal.js](https://github.com/joesteele/rack-talk/tree/master/slides) with a custom theme used.
